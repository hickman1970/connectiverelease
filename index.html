	    <h3>Fascia - What is it?</h3>
	    <p>Fascia is a connective tissue that weaves around nerves, muscles, blood vessels, and bones in a three dimensional web, without interruption throughout your body.  This tissue provides support, shock absorption, and creates space between structures.  When faced with trauma, poor posture, inflammatory process, stress, or a combination of any of these, the fascia will have a tendency to shorten and bind, causing excessive pressure on structures, creating pain and loss of motion.  These fascial restrictions can be acute or develop over time.</p>

	    <h3>Myofascial Release  - What’s it all about?</h3>
	    <p>Myofascial release is a technique where the therapist uses gentle sustained pressure, stretching, and/or compression, performed with their hands directly on the skin.  The focus is to release these fascial restrictions that develop in the connective tissue so the client may improve movement and postural alignment, as well as function within a pain free environment.  The more frequent treatments that a client is able to participate with, the better the outcome to reaching painfree potential.   The myofascial techniques used at Connective Release, LLC utilize techniques from the John Barnes’ Myofascial Release therapy approach.

	    <p>Following visits will last 1 hour at cost of $80.  Fifth visit is ½ price!</p>
	    
	    <p>Attire for treatment:  With myofascial release being performed directly on the skin, clothing such as sports bra, shorts, tank top would work.</p>
